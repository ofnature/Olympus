# Changelog

All notable changes to Daedalus will be documented in this file.

<!-- LATEST-START -->
## v4.17.2 — 2026-05-06

### Fix — Plugin Marked as Outdated After Dalamud 15
- Dalamud bumped its API level for the latest game patch, which caused Daedalus to show as outdated and incompatible and refuse to load
- Rebuilt against the new Dalamud and updated the declared API level so Daedalus loads again. No behavior changes, just a compatibility fix
<!-- LATEST-END -->

## v4.17.1 — 2026-05-02

### Fix — Plugin Failed to Load After Dalamud Update
- The latest Dalamud update changed an internal API that Daedalus relied on, which caused the plugin to fail loading with a "Method not found" error
- Rebuilt against the new Dalamud so Daedalus loads cleanly again. No behavior changes, just a compatibility fix

## v4.17.0 — 2026-05-02

### New — Pre-Pull Tincture Automation
- Daedalus can now pop a tincture for you on the opener and re-pot on cooldown after that, both aligned to your burst window
- Picks the matching stat tincture for your job (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Mind) and prefers HQ if you have one
- Gated to high-end duties (savage, extreme, ultimate) so it never fires in roulettes or open world by accident
- Off by default. Opt in under the new Consumables tab if you want it

### New — Modifier-Key Burst Overrides
- Hold Shift to force the bot to act as if you're already in burst (skip pooling, fire now). Hold Ctrl to force the opposite (always pool resources). Useful for committing early or saving a window the timeline didn't predict
- Off by default because Shift and Ctrl conflict with chat typing. Turn it on under Input if you want it
- Affects pooling decisions across roughly 30 sites including Saber Dance, ninjutsu pooling, Manafication, and any gauge spender that holds for burst

### New — Feint and Addle Across All Melee and Caster DPS
- Daedalus now fires Feint on all 6 melee DPS (Monk, Ninja, Dragoon, Samurai, Reaper, Viper) and Addle on all 4 caster DPS (Black Mage, Summoner, Red Mage, Pictomancer). Previously only Viper had Feint wired
- Both are coordinated across multiple Daedalus instances. Two casters running Daedalus will not double-Addle the same boss; same for melee Feint
- Per-job Enable Feint and Enable Addle toggles live on each job's Role Actions section, default on

### New — Second Wind and Bloodbath on All Melee DPS
- Daedalus now uses Second Wind (HP threshold default 50%) and Bloodbath (default 85%) on all 6 melee DPS instead of only Viper
- Toggles consolidated onto a new Melee shared tab so you set them once for the role

### Faster Burst Detection from Party Buffs
- Daedalus now opens the burst window the instant a party member's coordinated raid buff actually resolves (Divination, Battle Litany, Brotherhood, Embolden, Searing Light, Devilment, Radiant Finale, Chain Stratagem), instead of waiting up to 200ms for the next status scan to pick it up
- GCDs that should slam during the buff window land sooner, and pooling exits faster on the opener
- The status scan stays as a fallback so behavior is unchanged if the cast event is missed

### Precise Mit-Stack Coordination
- Mit coordination across multiple Daedalus instances is now per-debuff instead of "anyone on the party used mit recently"
- Previously, Tank A using Rampart would incorrectly cause Tank B to skip Reprisal even though they are separate mit layers. Each ability now only skips when its own debuff is already active on the boss (Reprisal in its 10s buff window, Feint and Addle in their 15s windows)
- Wired across all 4 tanks (Reprisal), all 6 melee DPS (Feint), and all 4 caster DPS (Addle)
- Tank Rampart staggering between Daedalus tanks is also coordinated this way, gated by a new "Coordinate defensive cooldowns" toggle on the Tanks shared tab

### Faster GCD Submission for Tanks
- Fixed a scheduler bug that was rejecting tank GCDs during the action queue window. Gunbreaker, Paladin, Warrior, and Dark Knight now correctly submit the next GCD in the last 0.5s of the current cycle instead of waiting for full rollover
- Up to half a second of GCD latency removed across the four tank rotations

### Gunbreaker / Dark Knight
- Fixed an AoE combo step 2 ambiguity. Demon Slaughter (GNB) and Stalwart Soul (DRK) were gated only on combo step 1, which is also set by the single-target starter. In mixed target-count pulls the bot could fire the wrong step 2 and break the combo, dealing half potency. Now each step 2 only fires after its matching starter

### Settings UI
- Lucid Dreaming, Second Wind, Bloodbath, Rampart, and True North toggles consolidated onto their shared role tabs (Healers, Melee, Tanks) instead of being duplicated on every per-job page
- White Mage Lucid Dreaming intentionally stays on the White Mage page because it uses a predictive MP forecast that the other casters do not
- Pictomancer Lucid Dreaming UI now correctly binds to the shared caster setting
- Many previously-unread config toggles and thresholds are now actually honored across 16 rotations (gauge overcap thresholds, burst-pool flags, behavior knobs that had been defined but ignored)

### Behind the Scenes — Scheduler Migration Complete for All 21 Jobs
- The per-frame priority scheduler that started as a pilot on Gunbreaker in v4.13 and rolled out for several rotations in v4.16 now covers all 21 jobs. No behavior change you should notice
- The point is the platform: future fixes apply consistently across rotations, and the regression-test coverage that has been catching the bug classes called out in the last few releases is now in place for every job
- Adds dedicated scheduler-push tests for Feint, Addle, role-action helpers, and combo-step computation across 13 rotations

<!-- LATEST-END -->
## v4.16.0 — 2026-04-21

### New — Hardcast Raise Quick Toggle
- Added a Hardcast toggle to the overlay so you can flip between Swiftcast-only and hardcast raises without opening settings
- New `/daedalus hardcast` chat command does the same thing, so you can bind it to a hotbar

### New — Action Feed Overlay
- A new overlay shows a fading strip of icons for actions Daedalus just pressed, with hover tooltips (name, GCD or oGCD, action ID, age) and green or blue borders by category
- Configurable icon size, max count, and fade duration under General > Action Feed
- Off by default; useful for building trust in what the bot is firing when

### New — Pause on Channeled Abilities
- The rotation now pauses while you're channeling Passage of Arms, Flamethrower, Meditate, Collective Unconscious, or Improvisation
- Previously the bot would fire damage GCDs and cancel your channel mid-use
- Toggle under General (default on)

### New — Pyretic and Stand-Still Punisher Detection
- The rotation now halts every module (damage, healing, mitigation, buffs) while you have Pyretic or a similar stand-still debuff active
- Any action under Pyretic applies a lethal Vulnerability stack, so this prevents wipes on fights with stand-still mechanics
- Resumes automatically the frame the debuff drops
- Toggle under Targeting (default on)

### Mechanic-Aware Cast Gating Expanded to All Casters
- Previously only healer cast-time damage GCDs held for predicted raidwides and tank busters. That coverage now extends to Black Mage, Summoner, Red Mage, Pictomancer, Bard, Machinist, Dancer, and Paladin cast-time GCDs
- Swiftcast is now respected by the gate, so instant casts under Swiftcast are never held
- Summoner Carbuncle summon and Black Mage Blizzard AoE fallbacks also route through the gate
- Timeline settings moved to a dedicated Timeline tab under Behavior since they now apply to every role

### Earlier GCD Submission
- Action dispatch now uses FFXIV's action queue window, letting the next GCD submit in the last 0.5s of the current cycle instead of waiting for full rollover
- Noticeably reduces the dead air between GCDs, especially under latency
- Hardcasts still submit at rollover so a follow-up isn't committed before the current cast lands

### Dancer
- Retuned burst alignment. Flourish now fires on the off-2-minute (when Devilment has more than 55s left) instead of inside Devilment, and no longer waits for an existing Silken proc to drop
- Saber Dance no longer pools Esprit while a burst window is imminent, so partner Esprit ticks stop overcapping
- Tillana moved below Dance of the Dawn and Saber Dance so the Esprit it generates has room to spend before Flourishing Finish falls off
- Standard Step now respects the Delay Standard for Technical and Hold Standard for Technical config options instead of a hardcoded 5s window
- Added the missing Single and Double Standard Finish and Technical Finish action variants
- Fan Dance II minimum level corrected to 50

### Samurai
- Default AoE threshold lowered from 3 enemies to 2 (break-even for Fuko and better Fugetsu/Fuka maintenance on 2-mob pulls)
- AoE combo no longer drops back to single-target Jinpu if an enemy walks out of range mid-chain; Mangetsu and Oka finish the Sen the rotation already committed to
- Added Lv.100 Tendo action definitions (Tendo Goken and Tendo Setsugekka) so the bot tracks the buff-upgraded versions
- Iaijutsu, Higanbana, Tenka Goken, Midare Setsugekka, and Ogi Namikiri cast times corrected to 1.8s

### Monk
- Default AoE threshold lowered from 3 enemies to 2 (break-even for Arm of the Destroyer and faster Chakra building)
- Added out-of-combat Meditation so Monk builds Chakra pre-pull instead of standing idle, giving the opener roughly three free Forbidden Chakra of potency
- Updated Meditation to the Dawntrail Steeled Meditation upgrade chain (the old action was removed)
- Brotherhood status ID corrected; it was pointing at Meditative Brotherhood, so "during Brotherhood" checks were firing on the wrong buff
- Fire's Reply recast corrected to 2.5s (was misclassified as an oGCD)
- Fire's and Wind's Rumination status IDs corrected; Wind's Reply minimum level corrected to 96

### Red Mage
- Fixed the melee combo silently dropping after Enchanted Riposte. The game rejects the Enchanted Zwerchhau and Redoublement replacement IDs, so the bot was falling through to ranged filler spells instead of finishing the combo. Base action IDs are now used and the game upgrades them server-side during Manafication or Embolden
- Contre Sixte recast corrected to 45s

### Warrior
- Added Primal Wrath (Lv.96), the self-centered AoE oGCD granted by the Wrathful status at 3 stacks of Burgeoning Fury. Previously the proc was dropped every burst window because the ability wasn't wired at all
- New Enable Primal Wrath toggle under Warrior config (default on)

### Dark Knight
- Disabled the legacy Dark Arts logic. The Dark Arts status was removed in Shadowbringers; the old constant was colliding with Dark Missionary, so "has Dark Arts" was firing whenever Dark Missionary was up
- Added Impalement (Lv.96), the AoE Delirium finisher that was entirely missing
- Deferred ShadowedVigil detection to avoid a false-positive Shadow Wall trigger during Lv.96+ Delirium windows
- Edge of Darkness, Dark Mind, Disesteem, and The Blackest Night status IDs corrected

### Machinist
- Reworked Reassemble with next-GCD lookahead. It now fires only when the next GCD is a high-potency tool (Drill, Bioblaster, Air Anchor, Hot Shot, Chain Saw, Excavator, Full Metal Field), with a charge-based fallback to avoid overcap
- Replaced the old Reassemble Priority dropdown with a Reassemble Strategy knob (Automatic, Any, Hold One, Delay). The old dropdown was entirely unwired and let you pick a specific tool to hold Reassemble for, which isn't how any competitor does it
- Overheated state now short-circuits so Reassemble never lands on Heat Blast, Blazing Shot, or Auto Crossbow
- Tactician recast corrected to 120s

### Gunbreaker
- Fixed Fated Brand not weaving after Fated Circle (Ready to Brand status ID was wrong)
- Fixed Gnashing Fang and Reign of Beasts combo drops. Noble Blood and Lion Heart were being skipped and cartridges were spilling into Burst Strike because combo step detection relied on action replacement, which doesn't advance for the Reign chain. Combo tracking now reads the gauge directly
- Skip starting a new Gnashing Fang combo when enough enemies are present for AoE, so cartridges flow into Fated Circle during packs
- Rotation internals rebuilt on a new scheduler, and the 20+ bug fixes from v4.13 through v4.15 are now locked in with dedicated regression tests so these classes of bug can't silently return

### Reaper
- Added Lv.96 Executioner action definitions (Executioner's Gibbet and Gallows) plus the Executioner status
- Circle of Sacrifice and Bloodsown Circle status IDs un-swapped

### Astrologian
- Fixed The Arrow card status tracking. The ID was set to the action ID by mistake and was colliding with The Spear, so card-buff detection was wrong for both cards
- Fixed Lord of Crowns tracking. Lord of Crowns doesn't apply a persistent status, so the tracker was permanently waiting for a status that would never land
- Helios Conjunction status ID corrected
- Lightspeed recast corrected to 90s

### Sage
- Added Lv.20 through Lv.59 Physis so the pre-60 bracket has a party HoT option (the rotation previously jumped straight to Physis II)
- Haima, Taurochole, and Eukrasian Dyskrasia status IDs corrected
- Seraphism and Impact Imminent status IDs corrected

### Scholar
- Seraphism and Impact Imminent status IDs corrected

### White Mage
- Divine Caress and Medica III applied-status IDs corrected

### Black Mage
- Despair cast time corrected to 2.0s per patch notes (it was too long and breaking filler calculations)
- Umbral Soul minimum level corrected to 35
- Blizzard II action ID corrected
- Blizzard AoE fallbacks now route through the mechanic-aware cast gate

### Summoner
- Crimson Strike ID corrected (was colliding with Mountain Buster)
- Painflare minimum level corrected to 40
- Carbuncle summon now routes through the mechanic-aware cast gate

### Viper
- Remapped 20 Reawaken, Twinblade, and Legacy action IDs that had shifted one section in the game data. Twinfang and Twinblood oGCDs, Generation 1 through 4, Ouroboros, Legacy 1 through 4, Uncoiled Twinfang and Twinblood, Death Rattle, and Last Lash all now point at live game IDs with correct level gates
- Hindstung and Flanksbane Venom status IDs un-swapped
- Added the missing Slither gap closer (30s cooldown, 2 charges, 3 at Lv.84)

### Dragoon
- Drakesbane minimum level corrected to 64 (was 92, so it never fired below that level)
- Right Eye status ID corrected

### Ninja
- Ten Jindo and Deathfrog Medium action IDs un-swapped

### Bard
- Straight Shot Ready status ID corrected to the live Hawk's Eye ID

### Healer Sharing
- Preemptive spike detection is now shared between White Mage and Astrologian so both react to the same predicted damage signal
- Dynamic regen threshold is shared between White Mage Regen and Astrologian Aspected Benefic
- Damage-intake triage target selection (damage rate, tank bonus, shield penalty, healer bonus, time-to-die urgency) is now shared across Sage, Scholar, and Astrologian single-target heals. The toggle previously only worked on White Mage
- Co-healer awareness is shared across Sage, Scholar, and Astrologian single-target heals, eliminating duplicate per-job copies
- Shared healer prediction and timeline toggles surface on the shared tab

### Settings UI
- Sidebar reorganized into Behavior, Visuals, and Multiplayer categories
- Shared role actions consolidated. Lucid Dreaming (healers) and Head Graze (ranged physical DPS) now live on the shared tab instead of being duplicated on every per-job page
- Debug section visibility toggles moved out of the Debug window into a dedicated Display settings page
- Healer-only debug tabs are now hidden when a non-healer job is active
- Removed dead Shared pages for melee, ranged, and caster DPS that held only informational text
- Fixed duplicate Shared sidebar entries that were swallowing clicks
- Fixed the debug tab bar breaking when the Actions tab was selected
- Removed two unwired priority dropdowns (Ninja Single Target Ninjutsu Priority, Black Mage Movement Priority) that had no effect on the rotation

### Localization
- Fixed malformed JSON in 8 non-English locale files (de, es, fr, ja, ko, pt, ru, zh) that had been breaking string loads
- Fixed a duplicate phrase in the German Timeline section

<!-- LATEST-END -->
## v4.15.0 — 2026-04-14

### New — Drop-Target Safety
- Dropping your target now hard-stops damage — useful for gaze mechanics, disengage, or any moment you need to stop attacking instantly
- Explicit target strategies (Current Target, Focus Target) no longer silently fall back to "lowest HP" when you drop your target, so the rotation respects your intent
- Enemy-needing-DoT logic now honors your Enemy strategy — explicit strategies only apply DoTs to your selected enemy instead of spilling them onto adds with reflect or damage-down debuffs

### New — Smart Gap Closers
- Gap closers (Onslaught, Intervene, Trajectory, Shadowstride, Thunderclap, High Jump, Spineshatter Dive, Dragonfire Dive, Stardiver) are now blocked when the current target isn't your explicit selection, or when you've just gained distance from the target — prevents the rotation from yanking you back into mechanics you were actively running from
- Toggle available under Targeting (default on)

### New — Forced-Movement Gate
- Damage GCDs are now suppressed while you're under Forced March, Thin Ice, or similar movement-override statuses, so casts don't fire during mechanics that control your position
- Toggle under Targeting (default on)

### New — Esuna for Scholar, Sage, and Astrologian
- All three were missing cleanse support entirely — only White Mage had it. All four healers now cleanse cleansable debuffs with priority-based detection (lethal > high > medium > low) and party coordination to avoid double-cleansing
- Fixed White Mage Esuna unconditionally blocking while moving — it now casts during movement when Swiftcast is up

### New — Targeting Invulnerability Filter
- Auto-targeting now skips enemies with known invulnerability status effects (immune boss phases, untouchable adds, ARR invulnerable crystals)
- Explicit Current Target and Focus Target are never filtered, so player intent is always respected
- Toggle under Targeting (default on)

### New — Mechanic-Aware Healer Damage
- Healer damage casts (Glare, Broil, Malefic, Dosis) now hold when the fight timeline predicts a raidwide or tankbuster will hit before the cast completes — keeps your GCD available for reactive healing instead of locking you into a 1.5s damage cast
- Healers now skip single-target DoT maintenance during dungeon packs when enough enemies are present for AoE damage
- Toggle under Healing config (default on)

### Ninja
- Fixed ninjutsu results (Raiton, Suiton, Huton, etc.) silently failing to execute after mudra inputs completed — the rotation was stuck in a "cast" state with nothing happening
- Fixed Ten Chi Jin doing nothing — all three mudra steps now fire correctly during the buff
- Fixed mudra sequences locking up mid-combo, which was previously masked as intermittent stalls by a 7-second bandaid timeout
- Wired several Ninki and Doton config settings that existed but had no effect (overcap threshold, minimum gauge, AoE use, AoE target count)

### Gunbreaker
- Fixed Gnashing Fang combo dropping back to Keen Edge after the first hit — combo tracking is now resilient to Continuation oGCD weaves
- Gnashing Fang now fires on its 30s cooldown instead of being held indefinitely for No Mercy
- Added the missing Fated Brand continuation proc for Fated Circle at level 96+
- Cartridges are now spent before overcapping from the AoE combo finisher

### Machinist
- Fixed Hypercharge deadlock where the rotation stalled between burst windows — tool-ready checks no longer block oGCD activation while the tools can only fire during GCD windows
- Fixed Gauss Round and Ricochet charge tracking reading the wrong action IDs at level 92+, which made the charges appear unusable
- Wired Queen Battery config thresholds that previously had no effect on the rotation

### Red Mage
- Fixed the Enchanted melee combo (Riposte → Zwerchhau → Redoublement → Verflare/Verholy → Scorch → Resolution) dropping after the first hit
- Added the Moulinet AoE chain (Enchanted Moulinet → Deux → Trois) — previously AoE just ran Impact forever
- Corps-a-corps and Engagement now hold when your HP is below a configurable threshold (default 70%) so they stop pulling you into danger while hurt
- Added a new Movement / Gap Closers section to the Red Mage config

### Warrior
- Added Primal Rend and Onslaught player-agency toggles (both default off) — Rend's 20y dash and Onslaught's melee lunge can yank you into mechanics, so the initial press is now left to the player
- The rotation still completes Primal Ruination once you press Rend, and still uses Onslaught to close gaps when you're out of melee range
- Added Enable Primal Rend and Enable Primal Ruination toggles in the Warrior config UI

### Dancer
- Dancer now preps Standard Step before combat in Duty Support and pre-pulls — previously the opener lost ~6 seconds of the personal damage buff because Standard Step wouldn't fire until after combat began
- Added automatic Closed Position that picks the best dance partner by job priority and re-partners on death (respects Manual selection mode)
- Reordered the opener so Standard Step fires before Technical Step when the personal buff is missing — cuts opener delay from roughly 9s to 3.5s
- Wired feather overcap, Fan Dance minimum, Esprit overcap, and Saber Dance minimum config thresholds — they existed in settings but the rotation was using hardcoded values

### Healers (All)
- Single-target oGCD heals (Benediction, Tetragrammaton, Lustrate, Essential Dignity, Druochole) no longer fire on tanks during invulnerability windows (Hallowed Ground, Holmgang, Living Dead, Superbolide) or on pending-heal buffs (Excogitation, Catharsis of Corundum). Shields, regens, ground targets, and AoE heals are unaffected — they still fire during invuln windows where they have legitimate value
- Party members afflicted by Doom now jump to the top of heal priority — Doom only clears at 100% HP, so a Doomed player always outranks anyone else missing HP
- Enemies behind walls are now filtered out of auto-targeting using a line-of-sight raycast (toggle under Targeting, default on)
- Player hitbox radius is now included in range calculations, so effective range matches what the game actually uses

### Scholar Fairy
- Fixed the rotation spamming Summon Eos every frame when Eos was glammed as Ruby Carbuncle (or any other pet glamour) — fairy detection now uses the underlying pet ID instead of the display name
- Seraph is now correctly distinguished from Eos via pet base ID instead of name matching

### Burst Windows
- The burst detector now scans the current enemy target for Chain Stratagem, Dokumori, and Vulnerability Up debuffs in addition to player buffs, catching team-applied raid damage windows faster
- AST Divination was added to the tracked player buff list

### Interrupts
- Interrupts across all 7 jobs that have them (PLD, WAR, DRK, GNB, BRD, MCH, DNC) now fire with a humanized reaction delay (0.3–0.7s into the cast) instead of snapping the moment a cast is detected

<!-- LATEST-END -->
## v4.14.0 — 2026-04-07

### Summoner
- Fixed Carbuncle not being summoned automatically at the start of combat
- Fixed primal summons and demi-summons (Bahamut, Phoenix, Solar Bahamut) failing silently, causing the rotation to loop on filler spells
- Fixed gauge reading issues that caused primals to never register as available

### Gunbreaker
- Fixed Reign of Beasts combo dropping after the first hit — Noble Blood and Lion Heart now execute properly

### Healers (All)
- Healers no longer cast heals out of combat (between pulls or after the boss dies)
- Healers no longer waste heals on players who just got raised and are still invulnerable
- Fixed targeting so rotations no longer attack enemies that haven't been pulled yet (e.g., distant training dummies or unengaged packs)

### Sage
- Fixed Eukrasian Dosis (DoT) failing to apply due to an animation lock timing issue
- Kardia now reliably stays on the main tank instead of sometimes swapping to DPS

### Pictomancer
- Added automatic motif repainting during combat downtime as a low-priority fallback

### Black Mage
- Fixed low-level Fire phase ending prematurely due to incorrect MP threshold ordering

### Tanks (All)
- Added over 40 new config toggles across all 4 tank jobs covering gap closers, oGCD damage, buff windows, mitigation cooldowns, and shared role actions (Reprisal, Interject, Low Blow, Arm's Length)

### Casters
- Wired several existing config toggles that were visible but had no effect: Black Mage Scathe movement toggle, Summoner ability group toggles, and Pictomancer individual creature motif toggles

<!-- LATEST-END -->
## v4.13.0 — 2026-03-31

### New — Paladin Clemency
- Paladin now uses Clemency as an emergency self-heal when HP drops dangerously low and no other mitigation is available

### New — Red Mage Verraise
- Red Mage now raises fallen party members using Verraise, with Dualcast and Swiftcast awareness and party coordination to avoid double-raising

### Summoner
- Fixed a bug where the rotation got stuck casting Ruin III indefinitely — primal summons now properly reset at all levels, and demi-summon activation (Bahamut, Phoenix, Solar Bahamut) no longer fails silently on alternating cycles

### Ninja
- Fixed a bug where the rotation could stop executing entirely — if a mudra sequence was interrupted or timed out, the rotation would freeze instead of resuming normal combat

### Healers (All)
- Fixed a bug where healers applied DoTs to training dummies the player hadn't engaged yet (e.g., dummies on the other side of the area)

### Tanks (All)
- Fixed Dark Knight and Gunbreaker ignoring the AoE enable toggle and minimum targets setting

### Config Cleanup
- Removed 25+ settings toggles across multiple DPS jobs that were visible in the UI but had no effect on the rotation — this reduces confusion and keeps the settings page honest
- Fixed 11 DPS rotation abilities that were ignoring their enable/disable toggles
- Fixed Apollo Aquaveil activating even when healing was disabled
- White Mage config section is now fully localized
- Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian added to the language selector

### Settings Validation
- Fixed overcap thresholds not being clamped during auto-fix
- Added Gunbreaker Heart of Corundum validation
- IPC protocol version mismatches now log a warning instead of silently failing

### Stability
- Fixed multiple thread-safety issues across party coordination, combat tracking, action history, damage trends, and performance monitoring
- Fixed a timeline sync drift in looping fights
- Sensitive fields are now excluded from config export

<!-- LATEST-END -->
## v4.12.0 — 2026-03-24

### New — Post-Fight Coaching
- After each combat encounter, a coaching summary now appears with callouts across 7 categories (healing, mitigation, cooldown usage, burst alignment, resource management, uptime, and deaths) plus an overall grade
- A new Pull History tab lets you review past encounters from your current session
- The summary popup is off by default — enable it in settings under Fight Summary

### New — Draw Helper & Targeting
- A visual Draw Helper overlay shows AoE targeting zones, positional indicators, and facing guides in real time
- Smart AoE targeting now picks the position that hits the most enemies instead of always centering on your current target
- Auto-attack is now detected and used as a combat start signal for more reliable rotation activation

### New — Mechanic Forecast Overlay
- The in-game overlay now shows upcoming boss mechanics from the fight timeline, so you can see what's coming before it happens

### New — Training Mode Expansion
- Training Mode lessons and quizzes are now available for all 21 combat jobs (previously only a subset had content)

### Main Window
- The main window has been redesigned with a compact 2×2 navigation grid and footer links, replacing the old vertical button list
- The Enable/Disable button is now taller and more prominent
- The status header is more compact with the rotation label removed

### White Mage
- Fixed Regen being applied to all party members at high HP instead of only those who actually needed it
- Presence of Mind is no longer attempted on Conjurer (it's a WHM-only ability)
- Fixed Lucid Dreaming not activating when MP conditions were met

### Astrologian
- Fixed The Arrow status ID being tracked incorrectly, which could interfere with card buff detection
- Neutral Sect and Collective Unconscious can now be used proactively when the fight timeline predicts incoming raidwide damage

### Scholar
- Expedient can now be used proactively when the fight timeline predicts incoming raidwide damage

### Sage
- Lucid Dreaming no longer fires if the Lucid Dreaming buff is already active

### Healers (General)
- Fixed a bug where healing could be blocked entirely when the predicted heal amount exceeded the target's missing HP
- Heal prediction is now calibrated per job instead of mixing samples across different healers, improving accuracy in synced content
- Added intermediate heal scaling entries for better prediction accuracy in level-synced duties

### Tanks (All)
- Party mitigation abilities (Shake It Off, Heart of Light, Divine Veil, Dark Missionary) now fire correctly — a logic error previously caused them to almost never activate
- Reprisal now correctly targets enemies instead of allies and checks the damage gate properly on all four tanks
- Burst pooling is now connected to the burst window tracker for all four tanks, improving cooldown alignment during party burst windows

### Dark Knight
- The Blackest Night now falls back to Rampart when TBN is on cooldown during timeline-predicted tank busters

### Gunbreaker
- Bloodfest no longer holds indefinitely for No Mercy — it now only waits if No Mercy is coming back within 15 seconds

### Dragoon
- Battle Litany now fires after 5 seconds if Lance Charge alignment isn't available, instead of holding it indefinitely
- New settings toggles for Dragonfire Dive, Nastrond, Wyrmwind Thrust, Mirage Dive, Starcross, Rise of the Dragon, Spineshatter Dive, and burst pooling

### Samurai
- Ikishoten burst-hold now works correctly with the burst window tracker
- New settings toggle for True North

### Reaper
- Arcane Circle hold time now respects the configurable hold time setting instead of using a hardcoded value
- Fixed a logic error in Soul Spender that could prevent Gluttony from being used

### Monk
- New settings toggle for Thunderclap

### Ninja
- Ninjutsu toggle in settings now actually controls whether ninjutsu abilities are used

### Viper
- Reawaken toggle in settings now actually controls whether Reawaken is used
- New settings section for role action toggles and burst pooling

### Bard
- Bloodletter now respects its enable toggle and reads the AoE minimum targets setting from config

### Dancer
- Fan Dance III now respects its enable toggle and reads the AoE minimum targets setting from config

### Warrior
- AoE damage abilities now read the enable toggle and minimum targets setting from config

### Pictomancer
- New settings controls for Subtractive Combo, Rainbow Drip, Palette usage, burst pooling, Tempera Coat, and Lucid Dreaming

### Summoner
- Fester now respects its enable toggle
- Demi-summon phase tracking fixed to prevent abilities from being used out of sequence

### Machinist
- Full Metal Field and Excavator now respect their enable toggles

### Red Mage
- Burst pooling is now connected to the burst window tracker

### Black Mage
- Burst pooling is now connected to the burst window tracker

### Thaumaturge
- Fixed a softlock where the rotation could get stuck in Astral Fire III with no way to continue — Transpose is now used as an escape

### Settings
- Party Coordination is now configurable from the settings UI instead of requiring manual configuration
- Buff hold times for all DPS and tank jobs now use your configured value instead of a hardcoded 8-second default
- Settings validation now catches negative values in tank configuration fields
- Many new localization keys added across all settings sections for full language support

### Fight Timeline
- Forward label jumps in Cactbot timeline files are now resolved correctly instead of being silently dropped
- Timeline confidence now properly decays to zero after 2 minutes without a sync point (previously it stayed at 50% indefinitely)
- Boss mechanic prediction timing is now based on actual frame timing instead of an assumed 16ms, preventing drift on non-60fps systems

### Overlay
- Party member count in the overlay now updates reliably when members join or leave

### Performance
- Reduced per-frame memory allocations across combat tracking, party analysis, and damage prediction services
- Action name lookups are now cached instead of reading the game data sheet every frame
- Healer rotations now build the party member list once per frame instead of twice
- Party HP checks throttled to 6 times per second (from every frame) to reduce overhead

### Stability
- Fixed a crash on plugin load when the Smart AoE service wasn't initialized yet
- Fixed a crash on plugin unload caused by services being cleaned up twice
- Fixed several thread-safety issues in combat tracking, action history, party coordination, and boss mechanic detection that could cause intermittent crashes or corrupted data
- Stale damage-over-time entries are now cleared on zone transition instead of persisting from previous duties
- Fixed double-counting of raidwide damage in the damage forecast
- Fixed MP forecast rounding to match the game's discrete server tick behavior

<!-- LATEST-END -->
## v4.11.0 — 2026-03-18

### All DPS Jobs
- Ability toggles in settings now actually take effect for all 12 DPS jobs — Dragoon, Monk, Machinist, Samurai, Reaper, Ninja, Bard, Dancer, Black Mage, Summoner, Red Mage, and Pictomancer all had toggles that were displayed but silently ignored by the rotation engine

### Sage
- Sage now automatically uses mitigation cooldowns (Kerachole, Taurochole, Holos, Panhaima, Haima), matching other healer jobs
- Fixed a bug where the Addersting status was tracked with the wrong ID, which could prevent Toxikon from firing when charges were available

### Scholar
- Fixed an issue in Scholar settings where the Emergency Tactics and Consolation toggle descriptions were displayed incorrectly

### Tanks
- Paladin, Warrior, Dark Knight, and Gunbreaker now have job-specific settings (Cover, Passage of Arms, Divine Veil, Clemency, Nascent Flash, Holmgang, Living Dead, The Blackest Night, Dark Missionary, Heart of Light, Heart of Corundum)

### Settings
- Settings now show action icons next to toggle names, with a tooltip displaying the action's ID, type (GCD/oGCD), cast time, recast time, range, and AoE range
- Settings validation now detects gauge configuration conflicts for Ninja, Samurai, Reaper, Machinist, and Dancer — when the minimum gauge to spend is higher than the overcap threshold, the rotation can never spend that gauge and the issue is flagged with a suggested fix
- The Draw Helper and General settings sections are now fully localized for all supported languages

### Fight Timeline
- Fight timelines are now available for all 8 Pandaemonium Savage raids (P1S–P8S), enabling timeline-aware cooldown planning in those encounters
- Fixed an issue where P5S–P8S fight timelines were registered with incorrect zone IDs, preventing those timelines from activating in-game

### General
- Thaumaturge (pre-Black Mage) is now recognized and handled by the Black Mage rotation
- Archer (pre-Bard) is now recognized and handled by the Bard rotation
- A new Changelog window (accessible from the main window) shows the 20 most recent plugin updates
- Internal error tracking is now active, allowing suppressed errors to be surfaced in the debug window without flooding game logs
- Fixed a resource leak in the plugin's cleanup code that could cause instability when reloading or uninstalling the plugin

### Internal
- Role actions (Swiftcast, Lucid Dreaming, Feint, Rampart, etc.) are now defined once and shared across all jobs instead of being duplicated in each job's action file
- Minor cleanup: accent color consolidated to a shared constant, config sidebar category lists promoted to static fields to avoid per-frame allocations, and a redundant set lookup removed
- Automated integration tests added for all 21 jobs and core services, improving regression detection before changes reach players

<!-- LATEST-END -->
## v4.10.31 — 2026-03-16

### Viper
- The rotation now weaves Legacy oGCDs (First through Fourth Legacy) during Reawaken bursts, significantly improving burst damage output
- Death Rattle now fires automatically after single-target combo finishers
- Last Lash now fires automatically after AoE combo finishers
- Second Wind, Bloodbath, Feint, and True North are now active in the rotation
- Writhing Snap is now used as a ranged filler when out of melee range with no Rattling Coils available


## v4.10.30 — 2026-03-16

- Japanese translations are now available for all 21 combat jobs in the Training module — every lesson and quiz can now be displayed in Japanese

## v4.10.29 — 2026-03-16

- Pictomancer (Iris): Creature motifs now correctly alternate between types based on level when painting outside combat — Lv.96+ paints Claw/Maw, lower levels alternate Pom/Wing
- Pictomancer (Iris): During the Inspiration buff window (Starry Muse), missing canvases are now painted with reduced cast time rather than waiting for the next gap in the rotation
- Pictomancer (Iris): Hyperphantasia (granted by Starry Muse) now allows combo GCDs to be used while moving — no more lost uptime during the burst window
- Pictomancer (Iris): Subtractive Palette now fires immediately when Subtractive Spectrum is active rather than waiting for a burst window
- Pictomancer (Iris): Tempera Coat and Tempera Grassa are now used automatically when you or your party are taking significant damage
- Pictomancer (Iris): Smudge is now used automatically when moving and no instant GCDs are available
- Pictomancer (Iris): Swiftcast is now used during movement when no other instant options are available, preventing cast interruption

## v4.10.28 — 2026-03-16

- Tank cooldown abilities now pre-empt tank busters predicted by the fight timeline — major defensives activate up to 8 seconds before a known tank buster rather than only reacting after damage starts
- Damage forecasts used for healing triage now factor in timeline-predicted raidwides and tank busters, so healers and shields are deployed before mechanics land rather than in response to them

## v4.10.27 — 2026-03-16

- Burst resource pooling is now individually tuned for each DPS job — gauge resources and key cooldowns are held more precisely in the final seconds before a burst window rather than spending freely
  - Dragoon no longer accidentally triggers Life of the Dragon before burst when Geirskogul would activate it at an inopportune time
  - Bard uses Apex Arrow at a lower Soul Voice threshold during active burst windows to guarantee value under raid buffs
  - Viper holds Reawaken to enter it inside the burst window (bypassed when Ready to Reawaken proc is available)
  - Pictomancer delays Hammer Stamp activation to align the combo with burst timing
  - Red Mage delays entering melee combo when a burst window is seconds away
  - Reaper holds Gluttony so the Soul Reaver stacks it generates land under raid buffs; Enshroud is also now held for burst when Shroud is not near cap
  - Dancer holds Saber Dance when Esprit is not approaching the cap, saving gauge for burst
  - Machinist holds Hypercharge for burst when Heat is below 90
  - Black Mage holds Polyglot stacks for burst timing when below 2 stacks
  - Ninja, Samurai, and Monk hold their primary gauge spender when a burst window is imminent but the gauge is not near cap

## v4.10.26 — 2026-03-16

- Fight timelines are now available for Dragonsong's Reprise (Ultimate), The Omega Protocol (Ultimate), and Futures Rewritten (Ultimate) — the plugin can now predict upcoming raidwides and tankbusters in all three fights.

## v4.10.25 — 2026-03-16

- The overlay window has been rebuilt as a real-time combat HUD — it now shows your active rotation and job, a clickable ACTIVE/INACTIVE status indicator, your next queued action highlighted in green, HP percentage with a color-coded indicator, injured party member count, raise-in-progress alerts, and current positional (Rear/Flank/Front) for melee DPS jobs.
- The first-run welcome screen is now a three-page onboarding wizard — it walks you through key features, lets you enable the plugin and choose a behavior preset, and ends with practical tips and a Discord link.

## v4.10.24 — 2026-03-16

- Action metadata is now registered for all 21 jobs — previously only White Mage had full action data, which limited features like action-level filtering and heal/damage categorization to WHM only. All jobs now have complete coverage.

## v4.10.23 — 2026-03-16

- Add preset quick-switcher to the main window — switch between Raid, Dungeon, Casual, and other presets without opening the full settings window
- Fight session history is now saved to disk and restored when the plugin reloads — performance trends in the Analytics window are preserved across sessions
- DoT damage is now included in healing urgency calculations — the plugin accounts for pending tick damage when deciding whether to heal, reducing unnecessary heal spam on targets with active DoTs
- Add config import/export via clipboard in the settings window footer — share your settings with other players or back up your configuration
- Add Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian as selectable languages — strings currently display in English until community translations are contributed

## v4.10.19 — 2026-03-16 - Training Mode Now Fully Wired

**Training Mode**
- Live Coaching now explains decisions for all 21 jobs — every action in every rotation now records what it did and why, feeding the coaching panel in real time.
- Concept mastery tracking is now active for all jobs, so Struggling Concepts and mastery-driven lesson recommendations work across the full roster.
- Fixed a bug where skill level could never advance beyond Beginner through the quiz component due to a mismatched quiz ID format.

## v4.10.18 — 2026-03-15

## v4.10.17 — 2026-03-15

- Improved healer performance and reliability (no behavior change)

## v4.10.16 — 2026-03-15 - Training Mode Now Covers All Jobs

**Training Mode (All Jobs)**
- The Lessons and Quizzes tabs now show all 21 jobs, organized by role (Healer, Tank, Melee, Ranged, Caster). Previously only Healers and Tanks were accessible from the tab bar.

## v4.10.15 — 2026-03-15 - White Mage Thin Air and Glare IV Improvements

**White Mage**
- Thin Air now spends charges immediately when both charges are full, even when the party is healthy and no expensive spell is incoming. Previously charges could sit capped indefinitely during stable phases, wasting charge regeneration. The extra charge is now spent on the next GCD cast (Glare III or Dia) to keep charge regen flowing.
- Glare IV's recorded potency corrected to 640 (was 350). This affects Training Mode explanations only — rotation behavior is unchanged.


## v4.10.14 — 2026-03-15 - White Mage Cooldown Logic Fixes

**White Mage**
- Asylum no longer places when the party is at full health. It still deploys proactively before predicted raidwides and burst windows as before — the change only prevents it from firing unconditionally on cooldown when no one needs healing.
- Fixed Temperance, damage trend analysis, and high-damage phase detection incorrectly triggering due to outgoing damage to enemies being counted as party damage intake. These systems now only consider damage received by actual party members.

## v4.10.13 — 2026-03-15 - Debug Checklist Now Shows All Spells

**Debug Menu (All Jobs)**
- The spell checklist in the debug menu now shows every ability for each job, including full upgrade chains, utility actions, defensive cooldowns, stance toggles, movement abilities, and all role actions. Previously, only a curated subset was displayed.

## v4.10.12 — 2026-03-15 - Internal Quality Improvements

**All Healer Jobs (White Mage, Sage, Astrologian, Scholar)**
- Healing logic for all four healers has been restructured internally — each healing ability is now an independent, individually tested component. Behavior is unchanged.

## v4.10.11 — 2026-03-15 - Crash Fix on Death and Zone Transition

**All Jobs**
- Fixed crashes that occurred when the player died or changed zones. Rotation logic now stops immediately when the player is dead, preventing modules from running against an invalid game state. Zone transitions now also reset HP tracking and pending heal state, preventing stale data from a previous zone being misapplied to new entities that happen to share the same ID.

## v4.10.10 — 2026-03-15 - White Mage AoE Healing Fix

**White Mage**
- Fixed AoE heals (Medica, Medica II, Medica III, Cure III, Afflatus Rapture) not firing when enough party members were below the HP threshold. Two bugs combined to block all AoE healing: (1) a redundant overheal check was rejecting every Medica spell at the HP levels where healing actually triggers — at level 100, heal amounts far exceed the average missing HP at 80–85% HP, so this check was removed entirely since the existing HP threshold is sufficient gating; and (2) Regen was executing before AoE heals in priority order, meaning a single party member needing Regen would consume the GCD window and prevent AoE heals from casting even when multiple members were injured. AoE healing now takes priority over Regen — when the AoE target count is not met, Regen runs next as usual.
- Fixed Afflatus Rapture not being used as a fallback when the lily strategy is set to Disabled but all Medica options are unavailable — lilies are now always spent as a last resort for AoE healing if other options fail.

## v4.10.9 — 2026-03-14 - Internal Quality Improvements

**All Jobs**
- Overhauled internal test coverage across all 21 rotations to catch regressions earlier — healing spells, damage rotations, buff timing, and priority logic are now verified by automated checks
- Sage and Astrologian healing logic has been restructured internally for easier maintenance; behavior is unchanged

## v4.10.8 — 2026-03-14 - Smart AoE Targeting & Visual Overlay

**All Melee Jobs (Monk, Dragoon, Ninja, Samurai, Reaper, Warrior)**
- Added a positional indicator that shows which position you need to be in for your next melee action — rear, flank, or front — updating in real time as your combo progresses
- The indicator is suppressed automatically when True North is active or when your target is immune to positional bonuses

**Monk, Dragoon, Machinist**
- Directional AoE abilities (Howling Fist, Enlightenment, Doom Spike, Chain Saw, Bioblaster) now automatically target the enemy that lets them hit the most targets, rather than always hitting in a fixed direction

**Visual Overlay (Draw Helper)**
- New optional overlay showing your melee and ranged attack range as rings around your character, fading out when you are comfortably in range
- Enemy hitboxes are drawn when targeted, making it easier to judge distance at a glance
- Positional zones (rear, flank, front) are displayed on your target so you can see exactly where to stand
- Toggle and appearance options are available in Settings → Draw Helper

**General**
- Added an option to start the rotation as soon as your weapon is drawn and auto-attacks begin, rather than waiting for the first GCD

## v4.10.7 — 2026-03-14 - Bug Fixes & Performance

**White Mage**
- Fixed AoE heals (Medica, Medica II, Cure III, Liturgy) never triggering in 8-player raid groups — the check for whether party members needed healing used a threshold that was almost never met at level 100, so AoE heals were silently suppressed. They now fire correctly whenever enough party members are below the HP threshold (default 85%, configurable in settings).

**Sage**
- Fixed Sage's Lucid Dreaming threshold and toggle having no effect — the setting was reading from the wrong configuration entry, so adjusting it in the config window did nothing. It now correctly reads from the Sage-specific setting.

**All Jobs**
- Reduced memory allocations during combat, improving frame consistency for healer jobs in particular — the plugin now reuses internal data structures between frames rather than discarding and recreating them.
- Internal code maintenance with no changes to rotation behavior.

## v4.10.6 — 2026-03-14 - Internal Maintenance

No changes to rotation behavior or the user interface. This release contains internal code improvements only.

## v4.10.5 — 2026-03-13 - Debug Window Overhaul

**Debug Window**
- The 21 per-job tabs have been replaced with a single "Job Details" tab containing a dropdown that lets you pick any job, grouped by role — the tab bar no longer overflows and is much easier to navigate
- The correct job is automatically selected when you open the window, so you land on your current job's info without scrolling

## v4.10.4 — 2026-03-13 - Melee Range Precision

**All Melee and Tank Jobs**
- Melee range detection now uses the game's own built-in range check instead of manual distance math, giving maximum precision — enemies at the very edge of attack range are now reliably detected and engaged

## v4.10.3 — 2026-03-13 - Spell Checklist Debug Tab

**Debug Window**
- Added a new Checklist tab that shows every spell your current job should be casting, filtered to your actual level, with a cast count per spell and a Reset button to start a fresh session count
- Spells that have been cast show a green dot; spells not yet cast show a red dot, making it easy to spot gaps in the rotation at a glance

## v4.10.2 — 2026-03-13 - Large Boss Range Fix

**All Jobs**
- Fixed melee rotations incorrectly using ranged attacks when standing near large bosses: the plugin now accounts for enemy hitbox size when determining whether you are in melee range

## v4.10.1 — 2026-03-13 - Gap Closer & Debug Fixes

**Dark Knight**
- Fixed Dark Knight not engaging from range: Unmend now fires to close distance when the target is out of melee reach

**Paladin**
- Fixed Paladin not engaging from range: Shield Lob now fires to close distance when the target is out of melee reach

**Debug Window**

- Added Export button to the Action History tab — copies the current filtered history to the clipboard

**Main Window**
- Removed the Available Rotations list to keep the window compact; the active job is still shown at the top

## v4.9.9 — 2026-03-13 - Quick Toggle Overlay

**Main Window**
- Added always-visible floating overlay with one-click toggles for Rotation, Healing, and Damage — no need to open the main window mid-combat
- Overlay is draggable and remembers its visibility between sessions
- Open/close via the new Overlay button in the main window

**White Mage / Conjurer**
- Fixed Conjurer rotation silently doing nothing: CNJ now correctly uses Stone/Stone II for damage and Aero/Aero II for DoT instead of WHM-exclusive spells (Glare III, Dia) that the class stone doesn't grant
- Fixed DoT casting being blocked while moving for all levels — Aero and Aero II are instant cast and were incorrectly restricted

## v4.9.8 — 2026-03-12 - Positional Indicator

**Main Window**
- Added live positional indicator for all 6 melee DPS jobs (Dragoon, Ninja, Samurai, Monk, Reaper, Viper)
- Shows current position relative to target: Rear (blue), Flank (purple), Front (gray), or Immune
- Only visible when a melee DPS job is active and a target is in range; hidden otherwise

- Auto mode preserves existing detection behavior; override takes effect immediately without restart

**Debug**
- Fixed Action History panel showing no entries for all jobs except White Mage

## v4.9.4 — 2026-03-12 - Tank Rotation Fixes

- Progress bar shows overall completion for the selected job
- Skill level badge (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) displays prominently

- "Start This Lesson" button navigates directly to the recommended lesson

**Recommendation Types**
- "Start here to build your foundation" - No lessons completed yet
- "Continue where you left off" - Normal progression
- "Covers: [Concept] (X% success)" - Lesson addresses a struggling concept

- "All lessons completed!" - Congratulations message with quiz suggestion

**How It Works**
1. Open Training Mode → Lessons tab
2. The Learning Path panel shows your recommended next lesson
3. Click "Start This Lesson" to jump directly to it
4. Struggling concepts from v3.28.0 mastery tracking influence recommendations
5. Your skill level (from v3.27.0) determines progression style

## v3.0.0 — 2026-01-23 - Phase 3 Complete: Full Party Coordination

**Milestone Achievement**
- Phase 3 complete! Daedalus instances now fully coordinate across all party members

**Coordination Features (v2.6.0 - v3.0.0)**
- Healers coordinate single-target and AoE heals to prevent overlap
- Tanks coordinate party mitigations (Divine Veil, Shake It Off, etc.)
- Healers broadcast party mitigations (Temperance, Expedient, etc.)

- Healers broadcast gauge state for smarter resource decisions
- Primary/secondary healer roles auto-determined
- Resurrection targets coordinate to prevent double-raises
- Esuna targets coordinate to prevent wasted cleanses
- DPS burst windows align across party

## v2.31.0 — 2026-01-23 - Healer Role & Gauge Coordination

**Multi-Healer Optimization**
- All four healers (WHM, SCH, AST, SGE) now share gauge state with other Daedalus instances
- Healers declare primary/secondary roles based on job priority (WHM > AST > SCH > SGE)
- Secondary healers use lower healing thresholds (default 50%) to defer healing to the primary

**Gauge Broadcasting**
- WHM: Lily count and Blood Lily progress
- SCH: Aetherflow stacks and Fairy Gauge
- AST: Seal count and current card state
- SGE: Addersgall and Addersting stacks

**Role-Aware Healing**
- Each healer context now provides `IsPrimaryHealer` and `GetRoleAdjustedThreshold()` helpers
- Primary healer maintains normal healing thresholds and takes the lead
- Secondary healer defers healing unless HP drops below their lower threshold
- Enables more DPS uptime for secondary healers while maintaining party safety

**Existing Settings Used**
- `EnableHealerGaugeSharing` - Master toggle for gauge broadcasting (default: on)
- `EnableHealerRoleCoordination` - Master toggle for role system (default: on)
- `PreferredHealerRole` - Override auto-detection (Auto/Primary/Secondary)
- `SecondaryHealAssistThreshold` - HP% threshold for secondary healer (30-80%, default: 50%)

## v2.30.0 — 2026-01-22 - Tank Swap Coordination

**Tank Coordination**
- Tanks now coordinate Provoke and Shirk between Daedalus instances via IPC
- Prevents redundant actions when both tanks try to swap simultaneously
- Enables synchronized tank swap sequences for smooth aggro transitions

**How It Works**
- When a tank needs to swap (losing aggro), Daedalus requests coordination from the co-tank
- The co-tank confirms by preparing to Shirk (or vice versa for Provoke)
- Both tanks execute their swap actions in sync
- Falls back to solo action after timeout if co-tank doesn't respond (1.5s default)

**New Settings**
- `EnableTankSwapCoordination` - Master toggle for tank swap coordination (default: on)
- `TankSwapReservationExpiryMs` - How long swap reservations remain valid (3000-10000ms, default: 5000ms)
- `TankSwapConfirmationTimeoutSeconds` - Timeout before acting solo (0.5-3.0s, default: 1.5s)

## v2.29.0 — 2026-01-22 - Interrupt Coordination

**Party Coordination**
- Tanks and ranged physical DPS now coordinate interrupt abilities between Daedalus instances
- Prevents multiple players from interrupting the same enemy cast
- Tank interrupts: Interject (Lv.18), Low Blow (Lv.12)
- Ranged physical DPS interrupt: Head Graze (Lv.24)

**How It Works**
- When a player is about to interrupt, Daedalus checks if another instance is already interrupting that target
- The first player to interrupt reserves the target via IPC
- Other players will skip the interrupt to avoid wasting cooldowns
- Reservations expire based on remaining cast time (with 500ms buffer)

**New Settings**
- `EnableInterruptCoordination` - Master toggle for interrupt coordination (default: on)
- `InterruptReservationExpiryMs` - How long interrupt reservations remain valid (1000-5000ms, default: 3000ms)

## v2.28.0 — 2026-01-22 - Esuna Coordination

**Healing**
- Healers now coordinate Esuna usage between Daedalus instances
- Prevents multiple healers from cleansing the same debuff on the same target
- Currently integrated with Apollo (WHM) - other healers will follow

**How It Works**
- When a healer is about to cast Esuna, Daedalus checks if another instance is already cleansing that target
- The first healer to cast reserves the target via IPC
- Other healers will skip that target and look for other party members with cleansable debuffs
- Reservations expire quickly (2 seconds) since Esuna is instant cast

**New Settings**
- `EnableCleanseCoordination` - Master toggle for cleanse coordination (default: on)
- `CleanseReservationExpiryMs` - How long cleanse reservations remain valid (1000-5000ms, default: 2000ms)

## v2.27.0 — 2026-01-22 - Tank Invulnerability Coordination

**Tank Coordination**

- After using an invuln, broadcasts to other tanks via IPC

**New Settings**
- `EnableInvulnerabilityCoordination` - Master toggle for invuln coordination (default: on)
- `InvulnerabilityStaggerWindowSeconds` - How long to delay if another tank used an invuln recently (1-10s, default: 5s)

## v2.26.0 — 2026-01-22 - Resurrection Coordination

**Healing**
- All healers now coordinate resurrections between Daedalus instances
- Prevents multiple healers from raising the same dead party member
- WHM (Raise), SCH (Resurrection), AST (Ascend), and SGE (Egeiro) all participate

**How It Works**
- When a healer is about to cast Raise, Daedalus checks if another instance is already raising that target
- The first healer to start casting reserves the target via IPC
- Other healers will skip that target and look for other dead party members (if any)
- Swiftcast raises take priority over hardcast raises

**New Settings**
- `EnableRaiseCoordination` - Master toggle for resurrection coordination (default: on)
- `RaiseReservationExpiryMs` - How long raise reservations remain valid (5000-15000ms, default: 10000ms)

**Technical**

- New protocol classes: RaiseIntentMessage, RaiseReservation
- BaseResurrectionModule now integrates with party coordination service

## v2.25.0 — 2026-01-22 - Multi-Healer Ground Effect Coordination

**Healing**
- Ground-targeted healing zones now coordinate between Daedalus healers
- Prevents inefficient overlap when multiple healers place abilities in the same area
- WHM Asylum, SCH Sacred Soil, AST Earthly Star, and SGE Kerachole all participate

**How It Works**
- When you're about to place a ground effect, Daedalus checks if a remote healer already has one active nearby
- If overlap is detected (configurable threshold), your healer skips placement to avoid waste
- After placing a ground effect, Daedalus broadcasts its position to other instances

**New Settings**
- `EnableGroundEffectCoordination` - Master toggle for ground effect coordination (default: on)
- `GroundEffectOverlapThreshold` - How much overlap (0-1) before skipping, 0.5 = 50% overlap (default: 0.5)
- `EnableHealerGaugeSharing` - Infrastructure for future gauge-aware decisions (default: on)
- `EnableHealerRoleCoordination` - Infrastructure for primary/secondary healer roles (default: on)

**Technical**
- New IPC message types: GaugeState, RoleDeclaration, GroundEffectPlaced
- New data registry: CoordinatedGroundEffects.cs with radius/duration for each ability
- Foundation laid for gauge sharing and role declaration in future updates

## v2.24.0 — 2026-01-22 - Complete Healer Burst Decision Logic

**Healing**
- Scholar and Astrologian now deploy abilities proactively before DPS burst windows
- SCH (Athena): Sacred Soil, Whispering Dawn, and Fey Blessing consider burst timing
- AST (Astraea): Earthly Star placement now considers burst timing with longer maturation window

**How It Works**
- When `PreferShieldsBeforeBurst` is enabled:
  - Sacred Soil, Whispering Dawn, Fey Blessing deploy 3-8 seconds before burst (same as Asylum/Kerachole)
  - Earthly Star places 8-12 seconds before burst (longer window for Giant Dominance maturation)
- These abilities now also check for imminent raidwides (previously only HP threshold)
- Emergency HP thresholds still override proactive logic

**Technical**
- Added raidwide awareness to Whispering Dawn, Fey Blessing, and Earthly Star placement
- TimelineHelper.IsRaidwideImminent now accepts optional custom window parameter
- Completes the healer burst awareness feature from v2.21.0

## v2.23.0 — 2026-01-22 - Tank Defensive Synergy

**Tank Coordination**
- Tanks now coordinate personal defensive cooldowns (Rampart, Sentinel, Nebula, etc.)
- When two Daedalus tanks are in the same party, they stagger major mitigations
- Prevents wasteful overlap where both tanks use defensives on the same hit
- Maximizes mitigation uptime across tankbuster sequences

**New Settings**
- `EnableDefensiveCoordination` - Enable tank-to-tank mitigation staggering (default: on)
- `DefensiveStaggerWindowSeconds` - How long to delay if remote tank used mitigation (1-10s, default: 3s)

**Coordinated Abilities**
- Rampart (all tanks)
- Sentinel / Guardian (PLD)
- Vengeance / Damnation (WAR)
- Bloodwhetting (WAR)
- Shadow Wall / Shadowed Vigil (DRK)

- All 4 jobs now properly participate in two-way IPC communication

**Technical**
- Added Ikishoten, Kunai's Bane, Serpent's Ire, and Wildfire to coordinated raid buff registry
- Each job now calls `AnnounceRaidBuffIntent()` before burst and `OnRaidBuffUsed()` after execution

## v2.21.0 — 2026-01-21 - Healer Burst Awareness

**Healing**
- All healers now aware of DPS burst windows for optimized decision-making
- Healers can query party burst state (active, imminent, time remaining)
- WHM (Apollo): Temperance and Liturgy of the Bell consider burst timing
- SCH (Athena): Expedient considers burst timing
- AST (Astraea): Neutral Sect and Collective Unconscious consider burst timing
- SGE (Asclepius): Kerachole, Holos, and Panhaima consider burst timing

**New Settings**
- `EnableHealerBurstAwareness` - Master toggle for burst-aware healer decisions (default: on)
- `BurstImminentWindowSeconds` - How many seconds before burst to consider "imminent" (2-10s, default: 5s)
- `PreferShieldsBeforeBurst` - Deploy HoTs/shields proactively before burst windows (default: off)
- `DelayMitigationsDuringBurst` - Delay major mitigations during active bursts unless emergency (default: off)

**How It Works**
- DPS modules already broadcast raid buff intents via IPC
- Healers now consume this information to optimize timing
- When `PreferShieldsBeforeBurst` is enabled, Asylum and Kerachole deploy 3-8 seconds before burst
- When `DelayMitigationsDuringBurst` is enabled, Temperance/Expedient/etc. wait for burst to end (unless HP is critical)
