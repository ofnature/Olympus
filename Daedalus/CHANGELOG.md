# Changelog

All notable changes to Daedalus will be documented in this file.

<!-- LATEST-START -->
## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-27

### Fix — Esuna now cleanses "esuna check" debuffs by default (all healers)
- Unrecognized dispellable debuffs were treated as low priority and skipped at the default Esuna setting. Many dungeon/trial/raid "cleanse or wipe" mechanics use a unique debuff the bot doesn't have hardcoded, so they could be missed. These now default to medium priority and get cleansed at the default threshold. Known harmless movement debuffs (Bind/Heavy/Blind) are unaffected. Applies to all four healers

### New — Auto-Manage BossMod AI by role (group content)
- New opt-in option (Nav Control → "Auto-Manage BMR AI by role") for group content, where AutoDuty's BMR management isn't running. When on and BossMod Reborn is loaded, Daedalus feeds BMR a role-based stand distance (healers/ranged hold at range — default 15y, melee hug) plus the **live next-GCD positional** (so RPR/MNK/NIN get flank↔rear correctly, not a single static positional), in movement-only mode so BMR handles the pathfinding/safety while Daedalus keeps the rotation and targeting. You still enable BMR AI yourself (`/bmrai`). Off by default; does nothing if BMR isn't loaded

### Improved — White Mage
- Lily cap prevention is now proactive: it spends a Lily at 2/3 when the next one is about to tick (not only at 3/3), so a Lily regen is never wasted — which also feeds Blood Lily → Afflatus Misery faster
- Co-healer GCD gating: with a co-healer present, a White Mage set to the **Co** role now leaves non-critical GCD heals to the Main healer and oGCDs to keep up DPS (parity with AST/SGE). Critical targets still get healed, and it has no effect when solo-healing. New "GCD Heals Only When Solo Healer" toggle under Co-Healer Coordination

### Improved — Dancer dance partner
- Auto-partner now upgrades mid-fight: if a higher-priority partner becomes available (e.g. a better DPS revives or joins), Dancer switches Closed Position to them instead of only re-partnering when the current one dies. It only ever moves to a strictly better job, so it never flip-flops between equal partners (requires "auto re-partner")
- Refreshed the partner priority for the current patch — Pictomancer is now picked first, ahead of the melee, matching its top-tier value as a dance partner

### Fix — Dragoon combo broke after level 76
- Once Raiden Thrust (Lv.76) or Draconian Fury (Lv.82) replaced True Thrust / Doom Spike as the combo starter, the rotation no longer recognized the combo had started, so it kept re-pressing the starter instead of advancing to step 2 — stalling the whole 1-2-3. The combo now treats Raiden Thrust and Draconian Fury as valid starters, so the chain flows correctly at all levels

### Fix — Monk never reached Phantom Rush
- Perfect Balance was rebuilding the Nadi you already had instead of the one you were missing, so Monk would make Lunar (or Solar) over and over and never assemble both — meaning Phantom Rush, its strongest GCD (1500 potency), never fired. Perfect Balance now builds the missing Nadi each time (Solar = one of each form, Lunar = three Opo-opo GCDs), opening Solar first for the safest sequence, so the Lunar → Solar → Phantom Rush cycle works

### Fix — Viper Reawaken blocked in packs
- Reawaken required Noxious Gnash to be active for 10+ seconds on the current target. Because Noxious Gnash is a per-target debuff, swapping targets in a pack reset it to zero and silently blocked the entire Reawaken burst — overcapping Serpent's Offering. Reawaken now only checks that Hunter's Instinct and Swiftscaled (the buffs that must last through the burst) have enough duration, and Noxious Gnash is kept up separately by the Vicewinder path (same fix pattern as Reaper's Enshroud)

### Improved — Reaper ranged filler & smarter Enshroud
- Reaper now uses **Harpe** as a ranged filler when an AoE mechanic forces you out of melee range, so the GCD keeps rolling instead of dropping to auto-attacks (Harvest Moon is still preferred when Soulsow is up). Only used while standing at range — it won't waste a cast trying to fire while you're moving (unless Enhanced Harpe makes it instant)
- Enshroud no longer gets blown on a dying target in dungeons: if every enemy in range is about to die, it holds the burst. Never applies in trials/raids (boss HP makes it pointless). Tunable via "Skip Enshroud on dying target" under the Reaper Enshroud settings (default 5%, 0 to disable)

### New — Missing window (unlocked-ability check)
- Added a **Missing** window (button in the main window footer, next to Debug) that scans your current job's abilities and flags any that are high enough level but **not actually unlocked** — almost always an uncompleted job quest. Updates automatically for whatever job you're on. Handy when leveling via AutoDuty: if a key ability silently never fires (like Reaper's Enshroud before its Lv80 quest), this tells you exactly which quest you're missing. Expand "All expected abilities" to see the full unlocked/locked list

### New — Raid window (per-fight strategies)
- Added a **Raid** window (button on the main window) that shows the duty you're currently in and lets you set a per-fight targeting strategy for it. Turn on "Use a custom strategy for this fight" to override the enemy strategy, "switch off unreachable targets", strict explicit-target, and skip-invulnerable just for that duty — handy for split-boss fights where you want different targeting than your global default
- Overrides are saved per fight and applied automatically when you zone into that duty. Your global targeting settings are never changed, and a saved-strategies list lets you review or remove them

### New — Switch off unreachable targets (split bosses)
- When the enemy you're following is alive but out of reach — e.g. a boss split into an elevated "upper" part melee can't hit and a grounded "lower" part — Daedalus now switches to the reachable enemy and keeps doing damage instead of standing idle. It only fires when another enemy is actually in range, so chasing a single far-away target is never interrupted. New "Switch off unreachable targets" toggle under General → Targeting (on by default)

### Fix — No longer targets friendly NPCs
- Hardened targeting so Daedalus never locks onto friendly NPCs (Trust allies, escort/protect objectives, pets, chocobos) — only attackable hostiles can be auto-targeted or auto-faced

### Fix — Reaper Gluttony & Enshroud never firing
- Gluttony was effectively never used — its gate checked Enshroud's cooldown, but Enshroud is gauge-gated (its cooldown is almost always up), so the check was permanently false. Gluttony now fires on cooldown as the premium Soul spender (and at Lv.96 actually grants the Executioner stacks the previous fix added)
- Enshroud was being held in solo/AutoDuty: it required Arcane Circle active or Death's Design above 15s, so once the DoT ticked down with no party buff it never triggered. It now enters on cooldown once you have the Shroud gauge and Death's Design is up, which restores the whole Void/Cross Reaping → Communio burst
- Enshroud no longer waits on Death's Design and now fires as soon as you have 50 Shroud (outside burst pooling). Tying Enshroud to the DoT meant it never fired in packs when the current target briefly lacked Death's Design after a target swap
- Fixed slow Shroud generation: Death's Design was re-applying about twice as often as needed in packs (each target swap re-triggered it), stealing the Soul Reaver casts that build Shroud. It's now applied promptly when missing but no longer outranks your Shroud-building GCDs, so Shroud fills at full speed and Enshroud comes up on time

### Fix — Reaper Executioner finishers + Enshroud polish
- Fixed Executioner's Gibbet/Gallows/Guillotine (the Lv.96+ Gluttony upgrade) never being used — at 96+ Gluttony grants the Executioner buff, but the rotation only handled Soul Reaver, so the two high-potency stacks were wasted every Gluttony. They now fire with the correct flank/rear positionals, and a fresh Gluttony/Blood Stalk/Enshroud won't override pending Executioner stacks
- Ideal Host (free Enshroud) now triggers Enshroud even at low Shroud instead of being ignored
- Death's Design is now refreshed during a long Enshroud (so it doesn't drop mid-burst), Communio falls back to an instant Shadow of Death while moving (holding the last orb for Communio when you stop), and the basic combo is rushed to its finisher if the combo timer is about to lapse

### New — Tank wall-to-wall pulling
- While moving in a dungeon/trial, tanks now ranged-pull the nearest mob within 25y that isn't on them yet — including packs you're walking toward — so wall-to-wall pulls gather for AoE and nothing gets left behind. Works on all four tanks (PLD Shield Lob, WAR Tomahawk, DRK Unmend, GNB Lightning Shot)
- New "Tag Adds While Moving" toggle in the Control window (on by default). Only fires while moving, in an instanced duty, and never interrupts a combo

### New — Smarter tank add control
- "Don't Chase Lost Mobs": when a mob slips to another player, the tank no longer dashes after it — Provoke and a ranged attack reclaim it in place so you stay on the pack
- Paladin Holy Sheltron now spends Oath Gauge at cap for near-permanent physical mitigation uptime (toggle + threshold under the PLD Mitigation section)

### Fix — Paladin AoE
- Total Eclipse no longer loops forever without Prominence — the AoE combo now advances correctly
- AoE now triggers off enemies around you (the actual PBAoE radius), so spread packs no longer get treated as single-target
- A real pack breaks an in-progress single-target combo to AoE immediately instead of finishing the 1-2-3 first

### Fix — Samurai mid-rotation lockups
- Fixed stalls that dropped you into auto-attacks after Fuko/Gyofu and after weaving Kenki spenders
- Kaeshi: Namikiri and Tsubame-gaeshi follow-ups no longer get skipped after their Iaijutsu, and double Ogi Namikiri is prevented

### Fix — Rotation deadlock (all jobs)
- Fixed a stall where the rotation could sit idle for 10+ seconds doing nothing (e.g. Machinist after a combo GCD, or any job during AutoDuty). The internal "don't double-cast the same GCD" guard could get stuck and never release if nothing fired to reset it; it now clears as soon as the GCD recast finishes

### New — Auto-face target
- Daedalus now keeps the game's "Auto-face Target when using an action" setting on while it's running, so facing-required weaponskills no longer get refused while you're moving (e.g. AutoDuty running you around). Your original setting is restored when you disable or unload the plugin
- Look-away safety: while a gaze mechanic is being cast, auto-face is automatically suppressed so the bot's casts don't turn you into the boss (gaze action list is curated as mechanics are encountered)

### New — Auto-Peloton for ranged DPS
- Bard/Machinist/Dancer auto-cast Peloton while out of combat and moving (travel speed between pulls). Toggle under Shared Ranged Settings → Utility (on by default)

### Improved — Warrior
- Surging Tempest no longer drops during long Fell Cleave stretches — the rotation refreshes it (Storm's Eye) before it falls off
- Onslaught now weaves in burst (Inner Release) instead of on cooldown, and won't dash you while moving
- Bloodwhetting / Raw Intuition now reliably fires when you take damage: it has its own "Bloodwhetting HP Threshold" slider (default 70%) and, at or below that HP, weaves ahead of damage oGCDs so it's no longer starved out of the weave slot during burst (previously it could be skipped even down at ~17% HP). Set the slider to 100% to use it on cooldown as sustain
- Fixed Vengeance / Damnation never firing: at level 92+ the cooldown was queued but silently rejected by the dispatcher (it targeted the un-upgraded action id), so it sat unused all fight. Damnation now actually goes off
- Vengeance / Damnation now also fires on cooldown for big pulls: new "Vengeance Pull Size" slider (default 3) pops it when you're tanking that many or more engaged enemies (wall-to-wall), on top of the existing HP-based trigger
- New "Pre-pull Tomahawk" toggle (off by default): with an enemy targeted out of combat, opens the pull with Tomahawk

### Fix — Dark Knight
- The level-96 Delirium combo now completes: Comeuppance and Torcleaver fire after Scarlet Delirium instead of the combo stalling on the first hit — recovering the two biggest burst GCDs and the Disesteem proc. AoE Impalement under Delirium also fires reliably now
- Edge/Flood MP usage is smarter: Darkside refreshes before it lapses, MP dumps near cap outside burst, and during burst it spends down while keeping enough banked for The Blackest Night (closer to the 5/2 plan)
- The Blackest Night now also banks Dark Arts for damage: while you're actively tanking with MP to spare, TBN is used so the shield breaks and grants a free Edge/Flood (MP-neutral, plus a free shield). New "TBN Dark Arts banking" toggle (on by default); the HP-threshold slider still controls reactive shielding
- Dark Arts is now actually detected (it was being read as permanently off), so the free Edge/Flood from a broken TBN shield is recognized and the banking logic above works correctly
- Shadowstride no longer darts you around the pack: it's no longer woven as filler damage by default (only used to close the gap to an out-of-range target). New "Auto-weave Shadowstride" toggle (off) to opt back in
- Salted Earth (and its Salt and Darkness follow-up) now actually fire — they were blocked by a wrong action ID and never went off. Added a "Salted Earth Min Targets" slider (default 1 = on cooldown) so you can hold it for big wall-to-wall packs

### Fix — Pictomancer Hammer combo / Striking Muse never firing
- Fixed Striking Muse (and therefore the Hammer combo) never triggering, and Starry Muse firing late: their readiness was reading the cooldown off the wrong action (the morphed button instead of the base Steel/Scenic Muse gauge action). Now consistent with Living Muse, so the weapon/Hammer line and Starry burst come up on time
- Striking Muse and the Hammer combo now fire on cooldown in solo/Trust/dungeon content instead of being pooled to align with Starry Muse — short back-to-back pulls never reached that Starry window, so Hammer was being wasted. The Starry alignment still applies when coordinating burst with a party

### Fix — Pictomancer canvas/muse system dormant in pulls
- Fixed Pictomancer never using its motifs, muses, Hammer combo, portraits (Mog/Madeen), or Starry Muse during back-to-back pulls — it was stuck spamming only color spells. Motif painting was being out-prioritized by the basic combo and never fired in combat, so the canvases the whole system depends on were never created. Motifs are now painted in combat, timed to each muse's cooldown, so Living/Steel/Scenic Muse (and everything they enable) come online

### Fix — Pictomancer subtractive combo stall
- Fixed the subtractive AoE/single-target combo (Blizzard → Stone → Thunder) getting stuck after Stone, refusing to fire Thunder in Magenta and stalling the rotation. The combo-step detection was checking the wrong action for the final step, so it kept trying to recast the combo starter

### Fix — Stuck / spamming when not facing the target (all jobs)
- Fixed a case where the rotation would either stall or rapidly re-cast the same GCD (e.g. Pictomancer spamming Fire in Red during multi-mob pulls) when the auto-targeted enemy wasn't being faced. The game's auto-face only turns you on a *successful* cast, so a refused cast couldn't self-correct. Now, when a GCD is refused for facing, the target is re-faced (hard-targeted) so the next cast lands; submits that don't commit are throttled instead of re-firing every frame
- The "Why Stuck?" reason is now accurate for this case — it reads the real refusal (not facing / line of sight / out of range) instead of guessing

### Fix — Gunbreaker
- Bloodfest now actually fires: it was being cast on yourself, but the game requires it on an enemy target, so it sat "ready" and never went off (which also meant the Lv100 Reign of Beasts → Noble Blood → Lion Heart combo never triggered). Bloodfest now lands once per cooldown and the Reign combo fires inside No Mercy
- Royal Guard (tank stance) now auto-enables in combat like the other tanks — Gunbreaker previously never turned its stance on
- Fixed a mid-pull lockup where the rotation could freeze for ~10+ seconds after Bloodfest: the basic combo could desync and stop dispatching, starving cartridges and stalling No Mercy. The combo now always falls back to its starter and self-corrects

### New — Gunbreaker proactive mitigation
- Sustain cooldowns (Camouflage, Rampart, Nebula) now fire proactively on wall-to-wall pulls instead of waiting for your HP to drop — so you're mitigated before the damage lands, not after. New "Proactive Mit Pull Size" slider (default 3) under the GNB Mitigation section

### New — Main / co-healer roles
- New "My Healer Role" setting under Shared Healer Settings → Co-Healer Coordination (Auto / Main / Co). In a two-healer party, set one healer to Main (owns GCD heals) and the other to Co (defers non-critical GCD heals to the Main, sticking to oGCDs, shields, and DPS). This fixes the case where two auto-detecting healers would both defer to each other and neither would proactively GCD-heal. Applies to Astrologian and Sage; solo healing is unaffected

### Fix — Astrologian
- Divination now actually fires in solo, Trust, and AutoDuty content. It was being held for a party burst-alignment signal that only exists with multibox IPC coordination, so in uncoordinated content it sat unused the entire fight (a large DPS loss). It now falls back to using it on cooldown (~8s into combat) when no burst coordination is present, and still aligns to the party window when coordinating

### Improved — Astrologian
- Essential Dignity now uses per-charge thresholds instead of sitting on charges: a spare charge is spent proactively (new "spare charge" threshold, default 70%) while the final charge is banked for emergencies ("last charge" threshold, default 60%) — more healing throughput without losing the safety net
- New "GCD Heals Only When Solo Healer" toggle (on by default): with a co-healer in the party, non-critical Benefic/Helios casts are left to oGCDs and the co-healer to keep damage uptime. Critical targets still get a GCD heal, and solo healing is unaffected

### Improved — "Why Stuck" diagnostics (all jobs)
- Live "Last action: Ns ago" idle timer, a PAUSED banner that names why the whole rotation is idle (including "no action in combat"), and per-ability reasons for why a GCD won't fire (cooldown, proc, combo, out of range, line-of-sight/facing). The tank tab also shows enemy counts (in PBAoE range vs aggroed within 25y)
- Added a vNav movement state (Idle / Pathing / Finding path) and a live "In LoS / facing" enemy counter, so it's clear whether an idle is the character moving vs. no enemy actually being castable-at (line of sight / facing)
- The "why a GCD won't fire" reason is now accurate for internal holds too (repeat-GCD guard, submit latch, submit backoff) instead of mislabeling them as line-of-sight/facing
