///   2. <b>Moving-away guard</b> — if the player has been gaining distance from the
///      target within the lookback window, they are repositioning out of danger.
/// Together these cover the common failure modes (spread markers with AoE at the
/// destination, kiting during ground AoE, gaze mechanics) without maintaining a
/// per-fight status ID registry.
