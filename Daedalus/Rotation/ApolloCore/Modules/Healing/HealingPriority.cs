/// <remarks>
/// Priority order rationale:
/// 1. Emergency (Benediction) - Absolute priority for life-saving
/// 2. AoE oGCD (Assize) - Free healing while dealing damage
/// 3. Esuna - Cleanse lethal debuffs before they kill
/// 4. oGCD single-target (Tetragrammaton) - Free heals before GCDs
/// 5. Preemptive - Prepare for incoming damage
/// 6. AoE GCD - Multi-target healing takes priority over Regen when multiple members are injured
/// 7. Regen - HoT maintenance (only fires when AoE count threshold not met)
/// 8. Single GCD - Single-target GCD heals (most expensive resource)
/// 9. Lily cap prevention - Use Lilies before they cap (lowest priority)
